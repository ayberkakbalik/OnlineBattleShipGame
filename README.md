# OnlineBattleShipGame
 2 player battleship game played on LAN
In this project, we tried to make Battleship Game which runs in local area network (LAN). Python (version 3.9.1) was used as programming language. Therefore, you will need to install Python in your computer in order to run the game. You can use any IDE that supports Python. 

You need to download to Python files which are server.py and client.py. Firstly, you must run server.py. Then, you need to enter the server's IPv4 address in client.py file. You will be using it as a host. Therefore, write IPv4 address to host variable in client.py. After that, you can run client.py. Now, you can play.
